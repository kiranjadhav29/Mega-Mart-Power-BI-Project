# Mega-Mart-Power-BI-Project
Project Overview
The Mega Mart Sales Analysis Dashboard is a Business Intelligence (BI) project developed using Power BI and the Superstore dataset. This project aims to uncover deep insights into the sales, profit, and customer behavior across different segments, regions, and product categories of a retail business.

By transforming raw transactional data into an interactive visual story, the dashboard helps stakeholders understand business performance and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability and operations.


 Problem Statement:=
Retail businesses like Mega Mart face challenges such as:

Large amounts of unorganized sales data.

Difficulty identifying underperforming products or loss-making segments.

Lack of visibility into region-wise or segment-wise performance.

Inability to derive actionable insights from raw Excel files.

These issues lead to missed opportunities, poor inventory management, and inefficient strategic planning.

Solution Approach
To solve these problems, I followed a structured data analysis and visualization process:

1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Imported the raw Excel dataset (Superstore Dataset.xlsx) into Power BI.

Removed duplicate entries and unnecessary columns.

Handled missing or null values (if any).

Created calculated columns and measures using DAX for:

Profit Margin

Sales Growth

Discount Impact

Regional Contribution

Performance KPIs

2. Data Modeling
Built a proper data model with relationships between tables (if applicable).

Used a star schema approach to ensure performance and scalability.

3. Dashboard Development
Created a fully interactive dashboard with:

KPI Cards for Total Sales, Profit, Orders, and Customers.

Bar Charts for Segment-wise and Category-wise sales/profit.

Line/Area Charts for monthly trends in Sales and Profit.

Maps showing geographic sales distribution.

Tree Maps and Donut Charts for Category/Sub-Category analysis.

Slicers and Filters for dynamic selection (Region, Segment, Date Range, etc.).
